# Communication Guidelines

- Prefer clear, concise, and structured responses using Markdown headings, bullet lists, and fenced code blocks.
- Reference files, directories, classes, and functions with backticks (e.g., `src/app.module.ts`, `jira/application/queries/handlers/`).
- When proposing code changes, summarize intent, risk, and test impact.
- Ask for clarification only when there is ambiguity; otherwise, proceed autonomously and safely.
- Default documentation language for this repository is English. Commit messages should also be in English.
- Avoid exposing secrets or personal data. Redact sensitive information in examples and logs.
- For long-running tasks, provide progress updates and next steps.
